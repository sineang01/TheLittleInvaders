TheLittleInvaders
=================

The Little Invaders is the classical invaders game realized as coding test for a game company and then extended in my spare time to realize a micro-engine meant to run any kind of 2D game provided in the implementation.

Info
====

The Little Invaders provides a basic invaders game and a micro-engine to handle generic 2D games.
- The engine is a shared library able to link any graphical library (in this specific implementation the graphic library is called EasyPlatform)
- The game is another shared library seeking information from the engine using direct calls or event based procedures

Installation
============

Download the repository and compile on your local machine. You'll need CMake.
```
cd repository_folder
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```

`install` will copy all libraries and executables in the output directory.

Configuration
=============

Configuration files are provided in the output directory
* system.csv: used by the engine to load the graphic library as well as the main window
* variables.csv: game specific and, in this implementation, used to configure various properties and control objects speeds, player lives, number of aliens and so on
